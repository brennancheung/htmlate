htmlate
=============

htmlate lets your users upload their own templates in plain HTML.
Plug-in functionality can be added through classes, ids, and custom element tags.


Motivation
---
htmlate was created with CMS users in mind.  The requirements for CMS templates are different because:

  * Users should be forced to learn a new templating language.
  * Uploaded templates are insecure and should not be able to run arbitrary code.


Install
---

    npm install htmlate
