htmlate
=============

htmlate lets your users upload their own templates in plain HTML.
Plug-in functionality can be added through classes, ids, and custom element tags.


Motivation
---
htmlate was created with to meet the needs of 2 parties:

End users to CMS systems often have limited programming knowledge.  I wanted to set the bar as low as possible.  In htmlate
that bar is just HTML and CSS: no scripting knowledge or programming required.

Owners of hosted CMS solutions want to allow their users the ability to customize their templates but don't want to open their
servers to running arbitrary code.

I really like how AngularJS uses plain HTML and compiles it.  I wanted something similar on the server side.  I couldn't find
anything that followed the same philosophy so I decided to write my own.

Hopefully as web components take off, there will be better server-side support for them.  In the mean while...
